Red velvet cake is much more than vanilla cake tinted red. This recipe produces the best red velvet cake with superior buttery, vanilla, and cocoa flavors, as well as a delicious tang from buttermilk. My trick is to whip the egg whites, which guarantees a smooth velvet crumb.

chocklate:

step 1 Mix the ingredients
Place cocoa and butter in processor and mix until they form a paste. Now, heat a pan and fill it about 1/4 full with water and then place the bowl on top of the pan.            

Step 2 Whisk the chocolate paste
Now, put the chocolate paste in the bowl and then heat until the mixture is as just hot. Put the mixture back in the processor and mix till smooth.            

Step 3 Pour the mixture in the moulds and refrigerate
Then warm the milk to room temperature. Add sugar, flour and milk to the paste and mix the batter well so that no lumps are formed. Now pour the mixture into chocolate moulds and place it in the fridge till they become solid. Take the pieces out and munch away!
